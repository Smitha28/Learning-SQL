# Learning-SQL
Learn how to program in SQL and understand basic queries.
It's created by Mike Dane, do visit his website www.mikedane.com It's amazing! You have a bunch of tutorials for literally every topic in the programming world. 

I learned SQL in just over 4 hours by this interactive video by Mike Dane on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=6492s
This one covers the basics of SQL and if you have a time-constraint then this is the perfect option. I also have a book called "SQL for dummies" which is very good too and if you want a more detailed version.

Part 1 covers creating a database, inserting values into the database and updating and deleting entries from the database.
Compelete part 1 and then move onto creating a complex database as it will really help you understand some of the specifics clearly. 

I have posted the code which I tried out by following along his tutorials. You will need a text editor to execute this code. I used PopSQL. All of which Mike details in his videos. So watch and happy learning!
