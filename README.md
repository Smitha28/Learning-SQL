# Learning-SQL
Learn how to program in SQL and understand basic queries.
Part 1 covers creating a database, inserting values into the database and updating and deleting entries from the database. 

I learned SQL in just over 4 hours by this interactive video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=6492s
It's created by Mike Dane, do visit his website www.mikedane.com It's amazing! You have a bunch of tutorials for literally every topic in the programming world. This one covers the basics of SQL and if you have a time-constraint then this is the perfect option. I also have a book called "SQL for dummies" which is very good too and if you want a more detailed version of how to learn SQL.
