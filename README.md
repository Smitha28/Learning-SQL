# Learning-SQL
Learn how to program in SQL and understand basic queries.
Part 1 covers creating a database, inserting values into the database and updating and deleting entries from the database. 

I learned SQL in just over 4 hours by this interactive video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=6492s
It covers the basics and if you have a time-constraint then this is the perfect option. I also have a book called "SQL for dummies" which is very good too and if you want a more detailed version of how to learn SQL.
